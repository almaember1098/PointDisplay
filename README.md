# PointDisplay
This is a simple script I threw together to visualize points on a 2 dimensional surface.
I thought I would share it with everyone, use it for whatever you want.
It is licensed under the CC0 license. Have fun using it.
## Thank you
While I made this alone, there are a few people I want to thank (Yay stackoverflow people).
The following Stackoverflow users' answers were very helpful while making this script:
 - trahane
 - Ashwinee K Jha
 - Bryan Oakley
 - A. Rodas
Thanks for all of you <3
## Side note
The `points.txt` file contains some example points to use this script
(a JSON object every line, containing an 'X' and an 'Y' keys with the respecting values).
You are free to change it!
